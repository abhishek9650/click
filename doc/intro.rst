Click packages
==============

*Click* is the code name used to describe a packaging format for Ubuntu mobile
applications.  This format specifies how individual apps are delivered to
mobile devices, how they are packed into distributable format, and how they
are installed on a mobile device by a system provided package manager.  At a
minimum they assume that a base system exists providing all the necessary
infrastructure and dependencies needed in order to install and run such apps.

The click packaging format is completely independent from facilities to do
full-system installations or upgrades.
